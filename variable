we define variable inside variable.tf file. variables are defined inside the virable block and then we are going to give a vraible name. variable name should be uniqe.
you should not mention same again in variable file. in viable you will mention type description and default value




provider "aws" {
    access_key = ""
    secret_key = ""
    region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_security_group" "king" {
    name = "creating"
    description = "creating security group"

    ingress  {
        from_port = var.variable_from_port
        to_port = var.variable_to_port
        protocol = var.variable_protocol
        cidr_blocks = [var.variable_cidr_blocks]

    }
}

    resource "aws_instance" "ok"{
        ami = var.variable_ami
        instance_type = var.variable_instance_type
        vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.king.id]
    }

  

variable "variable_from_port" {
    description = "from_port"
    type = string 
}

variable "variable_to_port" {
    description = "this is to_port"
    type = string
}

variable "variable_protocol" {
    description = "this is protocol"
    type = string
}

variable "variable_cidr_blocks" {
    description = "this is cidr"
    type = string
}

variable "variable_ami" {
    description = "this is string"
    type = string
}

variable "variable_instance_type" {
    description = "this is instance"
    type = string
}




locals:
locals are similar to vairable we have 2 types in locals static and dynamic 
static is nothing but passing the vlaue in configure file.   dynamic means you will in local from var file . we can have multiple local blocks
each block has 1 or more variable. usually they keep locals on the top of your code.
