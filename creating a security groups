creating a security groups  we will take aws 

security group can be created in vpc oe EC2 level. it acts as firewall for your ec2 instance and it allow inbound and outbound traffic based on ports you specify.
  and proctocol as well like tcp http etc.

  when you create a security group things we required are like vpc , port, proctocol, cidr_blocks
  cidr is nothing but class less domain range it is private ips


provider "aws" {
    region = "us-east-2"
    aws_access_key = ""
    aws_secret_key = ""
}

resource "aws_security_group" "mysecuritygroup" {
    name = "new security group"
    description = "this allow inbound and outbound traffic"
    vpc_id = "aws_vpc.my_vpc.id"

    ingress {
        from_port = 443
        to_port = 443
        protocol = "tcp"
        cidr_blocks = {"0.0.0.0/0"}
    }
  
}
