first go to aws conscole and IAM 
create a user and assign policy to him 
once user is created go to security cerdentials section in am for that user
and create a access key 
open the vs code and go to terraform folder and open terminal

for windows

 $Env:AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="" 
 $Env:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="" 
 $Env:AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"

  for linux and windows:
 export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1

another we can mention key and id in main.tf file

provider "aws" {
region = "us-east-2"
access_key = ""
secret_key = ""
}


another way  instead keeping value in main.tf we can keep them in variable.tf files 
 create a vraibale.tf file

variable access_key {
type = string
default = "keepy your acces key"
description = "this is my acces key"
}


variable secert_key {
type = string
default = "your secret key"
description = "this is my secret key"
}

now go to your main,tf files

provider "aws" {
region = "us-ease-2"
access_key = var.access_key
secret_key= var.aceret_key
}
 


another way

 aws configure --profile dippy     --- this will work for windows unix and linux and mac this more secure way
